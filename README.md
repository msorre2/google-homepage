# google-homepage

*From The Odin Project's [Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)*

For this mini - project, you will deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.  The **goal** is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.  Use the browser's developer tools (right clicking something on the page and clicking "inspect element").  Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.

##Easy Version: Build the [Google](www.google.com) Homepage

**Inside your project folder, create your index.html file.**

1.  DONT BE A PERFECTIONIST! 
    * You're just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it!  It doesn't have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. 
   *Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.*
2.  USE GOOGLE! 
    * You'll probably run into roadblocks where you can't figure out how to do something, so do what all good devs do... Google it!
3.  If you're frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style the way you want (i.e. they seem to just not respond to any styles),  look into the css property -webkit-appearance: none; or -moz-appearance if you're using Firefox.
4.  Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. 
    You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your <img> tag.
5.  Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it.
6.  Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
*Do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page's source code) to help you along.*
7.  Push your project to Github!

##Difficult Version: Build the [Google](http://Google.com) Search Results Page

You should be able to reuse much of your code from before if you started with that project.  Again, don't worry about links to nowhere and forms that won't submit and hard coding the search results (which you'll have to do of course), just focus on placement and order of items on the page.

**Note:** 
>All the classes and id's and names of elements that you inspect on Google's home page are nonsensical strings (like div class='srg'). This is because the code was Minified, which removes or shortens unnecessary characters and names to help the page load faster. 
>The HTML (or Javascript or CSS) file will be smaller but the browser can still read it just fine.
