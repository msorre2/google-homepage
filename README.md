###Project: HTML/CSS
For this mini - project, you will deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it.  The **goal** is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.  Use the browser's developer tools (right clicking something on the page and clicking "inspect element").  Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.
